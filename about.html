<p id = "paragraph" >The idea of BLUE CRAYON is used because the blue crayons are most commonly used to represent the waters and the heavens.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >These are two parts of nature that are vast, admirable, and can exist in different forms. </p>

<p id = "paragraph" >Similarly, this is how I view the Black womxn who have raised me and the Black womxn that I have interacted with and bonded with on the internet.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >This is an homage to them and the powerful connections made through the Internet. </p>
