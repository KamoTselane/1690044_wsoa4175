<p id = "paragraph" > This website is a space where I would like to explore feminism, and the relationship between Black womxn and the Internet. It was suggested that I use this as a personal portfolio but I beleive that I can  both.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >The idea of BLUE CRAYON is used because the blue crayons are most commonly used to represent the waters and the heavens. These are two parts of nature that are vast, admirable, and can exist in different forms. Similarly, this is how I view the Black womxn who have raised me and the Black womxn that I have interacted with and bonded with on the internet. This is an homage to them and the powerful connections made through the Internet. </p>
