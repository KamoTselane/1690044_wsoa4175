<p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The
Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >Having been published during the midst of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, Sheen Magenya writes Making A Feminist Internet In Africa as her commentary on how the increased reliance and on the internet as a result of widespread quarantines and lockdowns have led to a deeper questioning of the (often neglected) consequences of this great move to the digital while rife access inequality still exists simultaneously. While doing so, Magenya skilfully highlights the ways in which African feminists are not only bringing interesting thoughts to technology, but that their existence in the space is almost crucial.  Sheena Magenya begins her dive into this discussion by stating “And this is why we need even more African feminists and feminisms on, in, around the internet, to counter the idea that technology somehow levels the playing field for all, and is an infallible solution to all our problems.” This statement not only sheds light on the labour that African feminists so freely dispense but it also sheds light on the fact that they are often still excluded and shit out from opportunities to make meaningful changes. The idea of using feminist thinking and innovation to attempt to deal with such a large issue is being presented as a way of highlighting feminisms persistence in maintaining firm equal access and authentic representation. Feminism is a space that demands critical engagement and creativity. As such, increasing the presence and value of feminisms “in and around” would be a step in authentically creating active resistance to online exclusion and bigotry, and abolishing of the prevalent inequality to resources that the coronavirus pandemic merely put a spotlight on. In Making a Feminist Internet In Africa, Sheena Magenya speaks about a 2014 conference held to address feminist analysis and understanding of the role of the internet and technology in the lives of those who use them. In the six years between the first of these conferences and now, it has become evident how large internet usage has become for a number of reasons that vary between LGBTQIA+ members seeking an online community to validate them and connect with, and victims of gender-based violence raising awareness of the issues being faced daily. The boom seen in the internet being used this was reveals how it is possible for online spaces to become a reflection of real life spaces. The inequality being mirrored in technology exists in forms such as rampant bigotry, and general lack of access of resources. The combination of the two result in a lot of silencing of voices and erasure of history. While the article’s early paragraphs outlined the ways in which the internet and technology are inaccessible to many Africans, it still progressed to highlight why the invisibility of these voices matter virtually. This is because they do not only exist in the digital, but their power and presence can slowly be felt and seen in the physical.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Medium Is The Message</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >In Marshall McLuhan’s The Medium Is The Message, the author delves deep into the layers which exist in the medium which produces information and the message that is produced by that medium. The Medium Is The Message begins with McLuhan discussing this idea of media and messages by looking at a machine. In this highly effective introduction, McLuhan explains this idea by breaking down the machine and looking at its different uses and productions. McLuhan argues that in moments of confliction with how machines are used, it is not the machine that is the issue, but it is what one does with the machine. The idea of the medium being the message in itself is in line with the idea of the potential that something has to do being held with in it, and its products.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >In this 2009 paper titled Semiotic Design and Analysis of Hypermedia, authors Elio Toppano and Vito Roberto discuss hypermedia design and its adopting of a semiotic approach. Semiotics refers to the study of signs and symbols and as such, the study carried out focuses on how meaning is constructed as opposed to the meaning itself. The large change between how previous approaches to hypermedia design and the one discussed in this paper is that, in the past, placed the largest emphasis on functionalities, this neglecting the importance of both the designer, and the problem of meaning construction. The proposed approach or framework was built for this paper using three principles. The first is a narrative approach which maintains and encourages order. The second is a semio-structuralist model which consists of compartmentalising into four parts, and the third is the communication perspective which is where the designer and user communicate through the hypermedia within a social and cultural context. The connection between the designer of the hypermedia and the user is important.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >The connection between the intersections of race, class and gender are not an isolated incident when discussing the internet and the digital space. The inequalities and injustices seen on the Internet with regards to these factors, are merely a depiction of what exists in the real, offline world that Black women maneuver through. In a 2005 journal article published by the University of Nebraska, Michelle M Wright – a literary, cultural, and political academic and critic – does a deep analysis on how the challenges and conditions faced by people are reflected in cyberspace as well. Wright breaks this dissection into three distinct parts which have a great influence on one another: the digital divide, experiences of Black women in tech, and the figuration of race and gender on the web.
