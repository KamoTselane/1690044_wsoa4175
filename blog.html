<p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The
Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >Having been published during the midst of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, Sheen Magenya writes Making A Feminist Internet In Africa as her commentary on how the increased reliance and on the internet as a result of widespread quarantines and lockdowns have led to a deeper questioning of the (often neglected) consequences of this great move to the digital while rife access inequality still exists simultaneously. While doing so, Magenya skilfully highlights the ways in which African feminists are not only bringing interesting thoughts to technology, but that their existence in the space is almost crucial.  Sheena Magenya begins her dive into this discussion by stating “And this is why we need even more African feminists and feminisms on, in, around the internet, to counter the idea that technology somehow levels the playing field for all, and is an infallible solution to all our problems.” This statement not only sheds light on the labour that African feminists so freely dispense but it also sheds light on the fact that they are often still excluded and shit out from opportunities to make meaningful changes. The idea of using feminist thinking and innovation to attempt to deal with such a large issue is being presented as a way of highlighting feminisms persistence in maintaining firm equal access and authentic representation. Feminism is a space that demands critical engagement and creativity. As such, increasing the presence and value of feminisms “in and around” would be a step in authentically creating active resistance to online exclusion and bigotry, and abolishing of the prevalent inequality to resources that the coronavirus pandemic merely put a spotlight on. In Making a Feminist Internet In Africa, Sheena Magenya speaks about a 2014 conference held to address feminist analysis and understanding of the role of the internet and technology in the lives of those who use them. In the six years between the first of these conferences and now, it has become evident how large internet usage has become for a number of reasons that vary between LGBTQIA+ members seeking an online community to validate them and connect with, and victims of gender-based violence raising awareness of the issues being faced daily. The boom seen in the internet being used this was reveals how it is possible for online spaces to become a reflection of real life spaces. The inequality being mirrored in technology exists in forms such as rampant bigotry, and general lack of access of resources. The combination of the two result in a lot of silencing of voices and erasure of history. While the article’s early paragraphs outlined the ways in which the internet and technology are inaccessible to many Africans, it still progressed to highlight why the invisibility of these voices matter virtually. This is because they do not only exist in the digital, but their power and presence can slowly be felt and seen in the physical.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Medium Is The Message</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >In Marshall McLuhan’s The Medium Is The Message, the author delves deep into the layers which exist in the medium which produces information and the message that is produced by that medium. The Medium Is The Message begins with McLuhan discussing this idea of media and messages by looking at a machine. In this highly effective introduction, McLuhan explains this idea by breaking down the machine and looking at its different uses and productions. McLuhan argues that in moments of confliction with how machines are used, it is not the machine that is the issue, but it is what one does with the machine. The idea of the medium being the message in itself is in line with the idea of the potential that something has to do being held with in it, and its products.</p>

<p id = "paragraph" >In this 2009 paper titled Semiotic Design and Analysis of Hypermedia, authors Elio Toppano and Vito Roberto discuss hypermedia design and its adopting of a semiotic approach. Semiotics refers to the study of signs and symbols and as such, the study carried out focuses on how meaning is constructed as opposed to the meaning itself. The large change between how previous approaches to hypermedia design and the one discussed in this paper is that, in the past, placed the largest emphasis on functionalities, this neglecting the importance of both the designer, and the problem of meaning construction. The proposed approach or framework was built for this paper using three principles. The first is a narrative approach which maintains and encourages order. The second is a semio-structuralist model which consists of compartmentalising into four parts, and the third is the communication perspective which is where the designer and user communicate through the hypermedia within a social and cultural context. The connection between the designer of the hypermedia and the user is important.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Convention and Context</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >In this 1983 article titled 'Convention and Context', Steven Maailloux uses the space to speak about conventions being "shared practices" in a particular field. As a game design student and digiatl artist, the use of conventions in work is highly discussed for the main reason being the necessity that we often have to make our work understood by the audiences who consume it. Mailloux goes on to desribe three common practices in utilising convention, in this article published in the New Literary History journal. The first is traditional conventions. These conventions recognize "past regularities" in actions. In other words, trends. Mailloux references Bert States and Paul Alpers to clarify this point by describing what they refer to as "shock" that is experienced by audience members of a thatre production when objects and practices that seem out of place or unexpected occur, thus breaking a convention. Mailloux states: "The innovation also shocks the medium itself: if other
artists adopt the practice and this adoption is not just a fad, then the unfamiliar becomes the conventional". This outlook begins to explain how conventions arise as culture develops and trends emerge in certain spaces and practices.</p>
<p id = "paragraph" >The second shared practice that Mailloux discusses is prescriptive conventions which regulate future actions. Mailloux quotes Gilbert by stating that  social convention exists "when most people think that one ought to do such and such in a certain context." The understanding makes clear the foresight that is often necessary, accompanied by the context of a particular action, in developing norms and regualrities that result in the birth a convention. ONe way that Mailloux argues for this understanding of the incoroporation of context in using conventions is through studying literary texts. Literary texts include punctuation and signs that indicate which interpretive conventions are appropriate for reading that text.</p>
<p id = "paragraph" >And, finally, the third way to utilise conventions that this article covers is constitutive conventions which determines present meanings. Mailloux describes context as comprising of "conventional and non-conventional" practices, therefore meaning that this is how the uniqueness of context is arrived at.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology</button>
<div class="content">
  <p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >In this paper, Steve Gibson discusses user interface, with a strong focus on the interaction between humans and the computer interfaces. This reading is very similar to Brenda Laurel's 1993 'Computers as Theatre' where Laurel breaks down computer-huan interaction and likens it to a theatre performance, describing the relationship between the two as a converstaion that is “mediated by a screen”. Simiarly, Gibson looks at this too. However, Gibson explores this concept on a much wider scale by looking at digital systems as a whole and examines interface startegies that "offer a wider range of sensory interaction with digital systems". A more concise way of understanding these alternative "digital systems" that do not solely focus on the mouse and keyboard and screen mediation is through looking at audio, video, text, image, and data. Although Gibson does not discuss this, one might also consider newer digital technologies such a Virtual or Augmented Reality to fall into the borad interfaces that Gibson would like to examine. Gibson begins with discussing cybernetic systems which refers to systems where the user is physically connected to a computer and/or digital environment. Gibson references technology developer Stelarc's creation of the first "genuine" cyborg. Gibson describes this as invasive as it incorporates th euse of an addition, digital third hand on the Australian performance artist who first interacted with this system. An additional system that Gibson delves into is hands free tracking systems. This concept, completely void of any physical touhcing of the user, is strikinlgy different to the first invention that Gibson discusses which is physically connected to the user. He describes them as "[hiding] evidence that there is any interface at all". The third interface which Gibson looks at is MIDI Instruments as Visual Triggers. This refers to musical instruments which relay visual signs such as that of synthesizers where communication is transferred on what keys were pressed via a MIDI Sequencer.

<p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Finding a Place in Cyberspace: Black Women, Technology, and Identity</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >The connection between the intersections of race, class and gender are not an isolated incident when discussing the internet and the digital space. The inequalities and injustices seen on the Internet with regards to these factors, are merely a depiction of what exists in the real, offline world that Black women maneuver through. In a 2005 journal article published by the University of Nebraska, Michelle M Wright – a literary, cultural, and political academic and critic – does a deep analysis on how the challenges and conditions faced by people are reflected in cyberspace as well. Wright breaks this dissection into three distinct parts which have a great influence on one another: the digital divide, experiences of Black women in tech, and the figuration of race and gender on the web.

<button type="button" class="bonuscollapsible">Bonus 2: Notes on Gender, Technology and Videogames</button>
<div class="content">
  <p id = "paragraph" style="font-size:180%;"><b>Notes on Gender, Technology and Videogames</b></p>
<p id = "paragraph" >While much of the work being dealt with this year and for this course deals primarily with the internet and utilising it critically, creatively, and skilfully, a lot of the unassigned content which I am choosing to additionally look at is to do with the role and existence of women (particularly Black women) in this space. This ties in very strongly to the overall goal of my website which is to discuss Black women on the internet. Tarcisio Torres Silva and Renata Jéssica Galdino’s 2019 journal article titled ‘Notes on Gender, Technology and Videogames’, speaks about “the digital gaps generated by gender hierarchies” and the different impacts that these hierarchies have on the oppressed gender. The most prominent point raised by Galdino and Silva is the observation that they have made of the reclamation of the digital space that women are slowly doing more enthusiastically. The aforementioned hierarchy which exists in technology is said to be a result of the inherent hierarchical struct that many science fields take on, thus streaming through into digital tech and videogames. This article very critically analyses the mere act of categorising genders and how deep-rooted it is in human culture. The authors state: “Female exclusion from scientific and technological practice was guided by scientific discourses, which postulated based on biological determinations that women would be less able to produce science and technology”. This analysis begins to breakdown how historic such perceptions are. As such, a gender gap was created where women and men were tasked with strikingly different roles which led to strikingly different opportunities, both in favour of men. This gap also considers the struggles which are, therefore, faced by women in comparison to those faced by men, ultimately creating an overall gap between the genders. Galdino and Silva then use this examination to discuss how this impact the Internet. They state: “What we learn from the history of the internet is that it was engineered, implemented, programmed, and spread by white men in academia and the military-industrial complex”. The authors of this article are both Brazilian and, as such, the article focuses more closely on the developments happening in Brazil. This does, therefore, leave me as an African woman slightly excluded from the relevance of a lot of what is discussed, as it tends to ignore the plights that I face and that I would like to read about. However, their ability to still acknowledge race as an additional factor in this discussion is affirming. Despite this, the Internet is still a tool which can be looked at to spot a number of trends and events. And although, the article does not specifically speak to my demographic, it speaks to a wider one that I can most definitely apply to myself and my work and my existence in the space of digital technology.
